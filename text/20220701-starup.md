## Startup

### What

In-depth study of optimizer theory, using Rust to develop an open-source state-of-the-art extensible and embeddable Cascades style CBO optimizer.

### Why

Deeply understand Cascades optimizer principle and become an optimizer expert.

### Who

We like people who are flexible, quick to learn, self-driven and passionate, and have a database background.

### When

Make an appointment before every meetup, at least once a week.

### Where

We currently meet online through wechat meetings, and occasionally meet offline.

### How

- Read papers
- Read open source projects
- Develop CBO optimizer with Rust
